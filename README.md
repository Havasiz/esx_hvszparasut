You can edit this freely. If you want to share an improved or edited version of this script, just please ask for my permission and credit me.

Altough I'm not sure, changing the folder name may break the script. Just don't change it.

## Installation

- Add a item called "parasut" in your database.

- Make sure you have ESX installed and working fine, a download link can be found below.

- [ESX](https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended)

- Then just copy "esx_hvszparasut" to your resource files and start them from "server.cfg"

## Configuration

- In server.lua, you can edit the item name to whatever you want (parasut -> X).
